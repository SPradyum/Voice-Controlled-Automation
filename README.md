- Make sure to speak the voice command clearly or change as per requirement.
- Follow the circuit diagram for creating the proper connection.
- Supply direct electricity to the BULBs only.
- Recommend powering the Arduino-Uno via a Laptop or power bank, which supplies power with only a maximum of 5 Volts.
